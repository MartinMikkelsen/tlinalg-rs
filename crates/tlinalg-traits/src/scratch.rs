//! Scratch acquisition.
//!
//! Implementations obtain every reusable buffer through [`Workspace`]. The host implements it over
//! its own pool, so the pool's identity, retention policy and steady-state allocation behaviour are
//! preserved and no second allocator is introduced.
//!
//! # Ownership
//!
//! Acquisition **transfers ownership** of a buffer to the caller, and [`Workspace::release`] returns
//! it. This mirrors the host pool: several buffers may be live at once (a thin SVD holds four), a
//! buffer that becomes a result is simply not released, and a miss allocates. A borrowing "lease"
//! contract would break both the simultaneous holds and the result hand-off.
//!
//! # Initialization
//!
//! Three shapes, and an implementation must pick the one each call site uses today:
//!
//! * [`Workspace::acquire_zeroed`] guarantees every element is zero.
//! * [`Workspace::acquire_uninit`] is the full-overwrite path: the contents are unspecified and
//!   reading an element before writing it is undefined behaviour.
//! * [`Workspace::acquire_capacity`] returns an empty buffer with room for `cap` elements, for call
//!   sites that populate with `push`/`extend` rather than by index.
//!
//! They are not interchangeable: swapping one for another changes either correctness or the
//! zero-fill and allocation counts the host measures.
//!
//! # Index scratch
//!
//! Use [`IndexWorkspace`] for integer scratch such as a LAPACK `iwork`: an index buffer is not a
//! numerical scalar, so it stays out of [`Workspace`].
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! A workspace is **not** used across lanes. Hosts acquire batch and output buffers before fanning
//! out, and per-lane scratch is allocated per lane. `Workspace` therefore has no `Sync` requirement
//! and no concurrent acquisition path.
//!
//! # Abandonment
//!
//! A provider may stop using a buffer without releasing it: on an error return, an early `?`, or a
//! panic. Abandoning is permitted and is not the provider's responsibility to tidy up — the host
//! owns token cancellation and unwind replenishment, exactly as it does for its own buffers today.
//! A provider must **not** release a buffer it abandoned, and must not release on a path where the
//! current implementation drops it instead; doing so would change the host's in-flight accounting.
//! Releasing is required only where a buffer is handed back on a successful path.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use core::mem::MaybeUninit;
//! use tlinalg_traits::{Scalar, Workspace};
//!
//! struct Owned;
//! impl Workspace<f64> for Owned {
//!     fn acquire_zeroed(&mut self, len: usize) -> Vec<f64> { vec![0.0; len] }
//!     fn acquire_capacity(&mut self, cap: usize) -> Vec<f64> { Vec::with_capacity(cap) }
//!     fn acquire_uninit(&mut self, len: usize) -> Vec<MaybeUninit<f64>> {
//!         (0..len).map(|_| MaybeUninit::uninit()).collect()
//!     }
//!     fn release(&mut self, _buf: Vec<f64>) {}
//! }
//!
//! let mut ws = Owned;
//! assert_eq!(ws.acquire_zeroed(2), [0.0, 0.0]);
//! ```
