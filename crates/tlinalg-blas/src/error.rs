//! Typed errors this crate reports to its host.
//!
//! Copied from the former shared `tlinalg-traits` vocabulary (same project, MIT OR Apache-2.0) and
//! now owned here: the interface tenferro requires lives in tenferro, and tenferro maps this enum
//! onto its own errors.
//!
//! The variants are shaped so that a host can rebuild its own error **kind, role and typed
//! payload** exactly. Two consequences follow from that requirement:
//!
//! * [`Error::Singular`] and [`Error::NonConvergence`] are distinct, because which one a provider
//!   reports for a failed factorization is routine-dependent (see the crate table).
//! * [`Error::NonFinite`] carries a [`NonFiniteRole`], because callers distinguish a non-finite
//!   input from a non-finite computed diagonal.
//!
//! [`Error::InvalidArgument`] and [`Error::Inconsistent`] are not "numerical" failures: they exist
//! because a host may have to reproduce its own argument/internal error shapes for these cases.
//! An implementation must not invent its own strings for them.

/// Linear-algebra operation that produced the failure.
///
/// The host maps these to its own operation names; implementations never format these values into
/// user-visible text.
