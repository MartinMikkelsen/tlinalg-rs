# tlinalg batched API (torch-like) — decision 2026-10-05

The maintainer's intent: the whole tlinalg (and tlinalg-blas) public API is **torch-like batched**.
A host calls each family **once per batch**; the library owns the batch loop (and, for tlinalg, the
batch-direction fan-out). Per-matrix entry points become crate-private helpers.

## Shape of every entry point

* Input: one `RawStridedRef<'_, T>` of rank `2 + B`, dims `[rows, cols, b_1, ..., b_B]`, arbitrary
  (validated, non-negative) strides. Matrix dims first, batch dims after (tenferro's column-major
  convention). `B = 0` is a single matrix. Batch iteration over arbitrary-rank strided batch dims is
  the library's job (shared helper), so the host never packs a batch just to call us.
* Outputs: compact column-major per item, items contiguous in batch order (item `i` occupies
  `[i*item_len, (i+1)*item_len)`). Output `Vec`s are **cleared and then filled**; total length is
  `item_len * batch`. No zero-fill pass: sequential paths push; parallel paths write into
  `spare_capacity_mut()` per lane (disjoint `MaybeUninit` chunks) and `set_len` once after every lane
  succeeded. On error the `Vec`s are left empty (cleared) — never partially initialised.
* In-place / direct-output routes (solve into a host view, compact Householder data, packed LU) take
  a batched `RawStridedMut` / compact `&mut [T]` covering the whole batch, and keep their existing
  "unchanged on failure" guarantees per item where they had them.
* Per-item scalar results (LU parity, RRQR permutation, …) are batch-length outputs too.

## Parallelism (tlinalg only)

* Arguments: `par: Parallel<'_>` (the call's pool + budget) and `plan: LanePlan<'_>` (host-resolved:
  `lanes`, `item_parallel`). The **host** decides lanes (tenferro's `lane_plan`: batch policy,
  forced strategies, thresholds, `can_fan_out_lanes`); tlinalg must not re-derive lanes.
* `plan.lanes <= 1`: run all items in order with `plan.item_parallel`.
* `plan.lanes > 1`: requires `par = Parallel::Pool`; install that pool, split the batch into
  `chunk = batch.div_ceil(lanes)` contiguous chunks, run each chunk as a `rayon::scope` task with
  `plan.item_parallel` for its items (normally `Sequential`, never nesting a second fan-out).
  This replaces tenferro's `for_each_chunk`/`with_outer_lanes` for linalg.
* Scratch is per lane and reused across the items of that lane (faer `MemBuffer` sized once for the
  item shape; host `Workspace` where the family already uses it).
* Errors: each lane stops at its own first failure and does **not** stop because another lane
  failed; the returned error is the one from the lowest-indexed failing lane, i.e. the
  lowest-indexed failing item — deterministic regardless of scheduling.

## tlinalg-blas

Same batched signatures, minus `par`/`plan` (LAPACK threading is vendor-owned): a sequential loop
over the batch, with **one** workspace query + acquisition per batch call outside the loop, reused
for every item (as `svd_batch` already does). Injected-symbol (`provider-inject`) support unchanged.

## Scope

Applies to every family, including the already-extracted SVD and packed LU (packed LU's chunk API
becomes the batched API; its fan-out moves from tenferro into tlinalg).

## Host (tenferro) keeps

Lane decision, dtype/placement dispatch, tensor construction, QR gauges, RRQR rank decision,
Householder append/from-factors/gemm, negative-stride rejection, error mapping.

## Behaviour change to record

Families other than packed LU previously looped sequentially over the batch in tenferro. With the
host's existing `lane_plan`, Auto policy now fans them out over the batch too. This is intended
(maintainer decision) and must be measured: tenferro-benchmark small-matrix batch cases.

## Addendum: multiple batch axes (2026-10-05)

* Keep `B >= 0` batch axes. One shared helper normalises them first: drop size-1 axes and
  **coalesce mergeable adjacent axes** (`stride[i+1] == stride[i] * dim[i]`), so the common compact
  case collapses to a single axis with a plain stride step — no per-item multi-index arithmetic.
  Only genuinely non-mergeable views pay for the multi-index walk (an odometer, not div/mod per item).
* Broadcasting: every operand of a call shares the **same batch dims**. The host expresses
  torch-style batch broadcasting by giving an input a **stride of 0** on a batch axis
  (e.g. one `A` against many `B` in solve/triangular_solve/lu_solve). Inputs may have stride-0
  batch axes; the kernel needs no broadcasting logic of its own.
* Mutable descriptors (in-place / direct output) must **not** self-overlap across batch items:
  reject stride 0 on a batch axis of size > 1 and any overlapping item ranges with
  `Error::InvalidArgument`. `RawStridedMut::new` only checks bounds, and parallel lanes writing an
  aliased item would be a data race, so this check is a soundness requirement, not a nicety.
  Overlap between a mutable output and an input is likewise rejected unless the family documents
  in-place semantics.
* Outputs created by the library (`Vec`s) are always compact with one flattened batch extent; the
  host reshapes them to the batch shape it owns.

## Implementation notes (tlinalg)

Recorded with the implementation; they refine, not replace, the contract above.

* **Shared driver.** `crates/tlinalg/src/batch.rs` is the only batch loop: descriptor validation
  and batch-axis normalisation (`BatchedRef`, `BatchedMut`, `BatchAxes`), lane split and fan-out
  (`run`), and output assembly (`Out` for library-created vectors, `InPlace` for host-owned compact
  buffers).
* **Lane parallelism.** With `plan.lanes > 1` every lane runs its items with
  `Parallel::Sequential`, matching tenferro's outer-lane children (`with_outer_lanes` hands each
  lane a sequential child context). `plan.item_parallel` applies to the single-lane case only. With
  `lanes > 1` and `par = Parallel::Sequential` the chunks run one after another on the calling
  thread, like `with_outer_lanes` on a context that cannot fan out.
* **Item offsets.** After normalisation a compact batch has one axis and an item offset is one
  multiply. A non-mergeable view decomposes the item index per item (`O(B)` integer work next to an
  `O(n³)` kernel) instead of carrying an odometer: items are addressed by index from independent
  lanes, so a per-item computation keeps them order-independent.
* **Destination aliasing.** A mutable descriptor is rejected unless its whole layout (matrix and
  batch axes) is injective under a sufficient test: after dropping extent-one axes and sorting by
  absolute stride, every stride exceeds the span of the smaller axes. Input/output overlap cannot
  be expressed: inputs borrow `&[T]` and destinations `&mut [T]`.
* **Output assembly.** Library-created vectors are cleared, reserved, and their spare capacity is
  split into disjoint per-lane `MaybeUninit` chunks written sequentially. `set_len` runs only after
  every lane returned `Ok` with its chunk full; otherwise the vectors stay empty.
* **Scratch.** faer work matrices and `MemBuffer`s are built once per lane and reused; buffers
  whose prior contents faer could observe (decomposition outputs, QR block coefficients, the thin
  `Q` seed) are reset per item to the state the pre-batching code allocated them in.
